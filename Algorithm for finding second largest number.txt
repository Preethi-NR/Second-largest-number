Declare and read the number of array elements.

Declare and read the array size at runtime.

Initialize two variables, max and second_max, to the smallest possible integer value.

Loop through the array of numbers and compare each element to max and second_max as follows:

a. If the current element is greater than max, update second_max to max and max to the current element.

b. If the current element is between max and second_max, update second_max to the current element.

c. Otherwise, if the current element is less than both max and second_max, ignore it.

After the loop finishes, return the value of second_max. 
Print the second largest number
